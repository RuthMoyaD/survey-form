# Survey Form Practice

This is a basic HTML form created as part of my early practice in web development.

The idea behind the project was to build a fun, music-themed survey using only HTML (and a bit of CSS). It includes common form elements like:

- Text input
- Number input
- Dropdown menu
- Radio buttons
- Checkboxes
- A comment box
- A submit button

## What I learned

- How to structure a form with semantic HTML
- Using different input types
- Grouping related fields
- Creating a basic layout without JavaScript

## Note

This project is purely for learning purposes. It's not connected to any backend and doesn't include real form validation.
